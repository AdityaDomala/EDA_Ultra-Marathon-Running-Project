# EDA - Ultra Marathon Running Project

This project involves performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a dataset related to ultra-marathon running. The goal is to uncover insights and patterns in the data using Python's data analysis libraries, primarily pandas and seaborn.

## Overview

The project covers the following key tasks:

### Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:
- Loaded and cleaned the dataset to handle missing values, duplicates, and outliers.
- Transformed and prepared the data for analysis.

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
- Conducted univariate and bivariate analysis to understand the distribution of key features.
- Analyzed correlations between different variables using visual tools like heatmaps.
- Grouped data by different categories such as race season, race length, and athlete average speed.

### Data Visualization:
- Used seaborn to create visually appealing and informative plots, such as:
  - Distribution plots for race lengths.
  - Boxplots and scatter plots to visualize relationships between variables.
  - Heatmaps to show correlations between various features.

## Libraries Used
- **pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **seaborn**: For visualizing the distribution and relationships of the data.
- **matplotlib**: To support the seaborn visualizations.

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AdityaDomala/EDA_Ultra-Marathon-Running-Project.git
